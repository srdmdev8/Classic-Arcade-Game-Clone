## How to Play

The goal of this game is to make your way to the water without coming in contact with any bugs.

### Instructions

The directional buttons will move your player on the game board:
- The **Up** arrow moves your player up
- The **Down** arrow moves your player down
- The **Right** arrow moves your player right
- The **Left** arow moves your player left

### Rules

- You will start with **3 lives** and **score 0**
- If a bug _hits_ you, you lose 1 life and your character is placed back at the starting position
- If you lose all lives _(lives = 0)_ and you get _hit_ by another bug, the **game is over**
- Every time you reach the water without being _hit_ by a bug, you get 1 point
- If you reach a score of 10 without losing all lives, you **win the game**
